## üöÄ Usage

Run the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lxqt-ly-switch.git
cd lxqt-ly-switch
chmod +x switch-to-ly-lxqt.sh
./switch-to-ly-lxqt.sh
```

After the script finishes, reboot to start using LY:

```bash
sudo reboot
```

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è What the Script Does

1. Disables and removes SDDM.
2. Installs build tools and dependencies for LY.
3. Clones and builds LY from source.
4. Enables the `ly.service` with systemd.
5. Adds a `.bash_profile` or `.zprofile` script that launches `startlxqt` on login.

This ensures that after logging in through LY, your LXQt session starts automatically.

---

## üìù Notes

- LY is a **keyboard-only** login manager. Mouse input is not supported.
- If `.bash_profile` exists, it is modified. Otherwise `.zprofile` is used.
- The script assumes the user logging in via LY will use TTY1.
- Debian systems: Probably works, but not tested.
